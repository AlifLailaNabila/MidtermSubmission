Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. A programming language is a special language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of
instructions for computers to execute.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK Stands for Java Development Kit. Jdk contains various components such as Run Time Interpreter, The Debugger, The
Aplet Viewer, The Header, API Source Code, The Class file Disassembler and The Documentation Generator.

What is IDE?
A. IDE Stands for Integrated Development Environment. IDE is an application which enables user to more easily write and
debug Java programs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, Intellij Idea, NetBeans, AndroidStudio, Enide Studio 2014, BlueJ, jEdit, jGRASP, JSource, JDeveloper,
DrJava etc.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. Java's life cycle starts with writing source code in a note pad or sublime or eclipse. Then we call the compiler java
to produce byte codes. Java compiler creates class file. Once the source code goes through compiler it produces
bytecodes. Then the java loader JVM interprets that with JIT in machine language and sends it to the operation system
and it gives output.

what is class?
A. Class is a blueprint of an object. in other words we can say that class is a template that is used to create objects,
and to define object data types and methods.

What is object?
A. Object is an instance of a class. Object determines the behavior of the class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main method is the entry point of an application.

Why main is static?
A. The main method is static because it can be invoked by the runtime engine without having to instantiate an instance
of the parent class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. java.lang.object is a superclass of all class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. 1). Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
   Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path, of classes.ie in J2EE we
   give the path of jar files.

   2). PATH is nothing but setting up an environment for operating system. Operating System will look in this PATH for
   executables. Classpath is nothing but setting up the environment for Java. Java will use to find compiled classes

   3). Path refers to the system while classpath refers to the Developing Envornment.

   4). In path we set the path of executables while in classpath we set path of jars for compiling classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. In interface, we can only declare methods which are abstract but in abstract class, method can be abstract and
nonÂ­abstract.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No, Because we can't create an object from any abstract class.

what is Access Specifier?
A. access Specifier just basically gives us access to the class.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology to design a program using
classes and objects. There are four features in OOP.
   Abstraction -> Abstraction is implementation hiding. We use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.
   Inheritance -> Inheritance is a way to aquire properties from one class to another class. It provides code reusability.
   Encapsulation -> Encapsulation is data hiding. We hide data by making the variables private.
   Polymorphism -> Polymorphism is basically an ability to take on many forms. There are two types of polymorphism
   (Method overloading, Method over writing)


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. The java.lang package is always imported by default as it is loaded internally by the JVM.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. Java API is a list of all the classes that are part of the Java Development Kit(JDK). It includes all Java packages,
classes, and interfaces, along with their methods, fields, and constructors.
   Iterator
   List
   ListIterator
   Map
   Map.Entry
   ObjectInput
   ObjectInputValidation
   ObjectOutput
   ObjectStreamConstants
   Serializable
   String
   StringBuffer
   StringBuilder
   System
   Scanner
   Random
   System

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. No.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. When same method takes different signature it is called method overloading it happen within class.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. The term exception is shorthand for the phrase "exceptional event."An exception is an event, which occurs during the
execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. The static keyword denotes that a member variable, or method, can be accessed without requiring an instantiation of
the class to which it belongswhen static key word is used with a method that method can be called without creating a
object.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.  A final class cannot be subclassed. A final variable can only be initialized once.
    A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final:
   Final variables are nothing but constants. We cannot change the value of a final variable once it is initialized.
   A final method cannot be overridden. Which means even though a sub class can call the final method of parent class
   without any issues but it cannot override it.
   Finally:
   Finally key word used to execute finally block when the try and catch block exits which ensures that the finally
   block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs.
   Finalize():
   Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to
   the object.

What is a constructor ?
A.Constructor is being used to instantiate a object by using new operator. It is an instance method with the same name
of their class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. Default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. it works as a reference to the current object, whose constructor or method is being invoked.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. super key word used for accessing the members of the super class by the extended class.

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A. No.

What version of java are you using?
A. 9.0.4
What is JAR stand for ?
A. Java Archive is a platform independent file format that holds many files into one. Multiple applets written in the
Java Programming language and their components like .class files, images, sounds and other resource files can be bundled
in a JAR file and downloadable in a single HTTP transaction. It supports file compression and digital signatures

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. JVM or Java Virtual Machine is an abstract machine and JDK or Java Development Kit phisically exist and it contains
JRE and development tools.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE is used to provide runtime enviroment, in other words it is the implementation of JVM, and the JVM is the virtual
machine that runs the bytecodes.

What is compile time and run time?
A. Java compile the .java file to .class file, this stage is called compile time. java loader loads the .class file in
JVM and JVM executes the application. This execution time of a application is called run time.

What is heap?
A. The heap is the run-time data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated. Heap is the
place where all objects stays during run time. It is part of RAM.

How java manage it's memory?
A. All the primitive variables and reference variable stays in stack. Heap contains the objects. Main methods executes
on stack. during the process of execution when a object lost his reference variable which is being erased from the stack
after completion of execution is waits for the Java automatic garbage collector, and object without no reference
variable being removed from heap by garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object getscreated, whereas StringBuffer and
StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.StringBuffer methods are synchronized while StringBuilder
methods are non-synchronized, it means that for thread-safe operations you must choose StringBuffer class instead of
StringBuilder.

What is Singleton class?
A. The purpose of singleton is to control object creation by keeping private constructor. Singleton pattern helps us to
keep only one instance of a class at any time.We can make constructor as private. So that user can not create an object
from outside of the class.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization: It is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or
database or can be sent through streams. Deserialization: The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes
is called deserialization.

when to use transient variable in java?
A. We use transient when we dont want certain part of our code to be serialized.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. The while loop checks the condition before doing the task assigned on the body of the loop, in the other hand the do
while loop does one task before checking the condition and if the condition is met it runs the second part provided on
the while body.

What is Enum?
A. Is a java type used to define collections of contants.

What is Iterator?
A. Iterator is an object that represents a stream of data.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. An int shall take 4 bytes and Integer shall take about 16 bytes space in heap.Integer are wrapper class which has
more overhead compared to primitive type. The memory space consumption by object depends upon JVM during run time
environment. For a object this space varies.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A. String objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable. Once string object is created its
data or state can't be changed but a new string object is created.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current
object. Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for
constructors in same class
From base class: by using super() keyword to call constructor from the base class.
Constructor chaining occurs through inheritance.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A. The serial collector uses a single thread to perform all garbage collection work, which is more efficient because of
no communication overhead between threads. It is best suited to single processor machines.

Parallel collctor performs minor collections in parallel, which can significantly reduce garbage collection. It is
intended for applications with medium-size to large sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor and multi threaded
hardware.

What is JIT stands for?
A. The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a component of the Javaâ¢ Runtime Environment that improves the performance of
Java applications at run time. The JIT compiler helps improve the performance of Java programs by compiling bytecodes
into native machine code at run time. The JIT compiler is enabled by default, and is activated when a Java method is
called.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A. Heap space: At run-time the Java instances are stored in the heap memory area. When an object is not referenced
anymore it becomes eligible for removal from heap memory.During garbage collection process, those objects are removed
from heap memory and the space is reclaimed.
    Heap memory has three major areas
    1. Young Generation
       a. Eden Space (any instance enters the runtime memory area through eden)
       b. S0 Survivor Space (older instances moved from eden to S0)
       c. S1 Survivor Space (older instances moved from S0 to S1)
    2. Old Generation (instances promoted from S1 to tenured)
    3. Permanent Generation (contains meta information like class, method detail)

     Garbage Connection:Java garbage collection is an automatic process to manage the runtime memory used by programs.
       Garbage connection of JAVA application is done by Garbage collector.
        A garbage collector performs automatic dynamic memory management through the following operations:
    1. It allocates from and gives back memory to the operating system.
    2. Allocate memory to the application as it requests it.
    3. Determines which parts of that memory is still in use by the application.
    4. Reclaims the unused memory for reuse by the application.
An object is considered garbage and its memory can be reused by the VM when it can no longer be reached from any
reference of any other live object in the running program.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. No it is not guaranteed process. Reason is as follows~
Being an automatic process, programmers need not initiate the garbage collection process explicitly in the code.
System.gc() and Runtime.gc() are hooks to request the JVM to initiate the garbage collection process.

Though this request mechanism provides an opportunity for the programmer to initiate the process but the onus is on the
JVM. It can choose to reject the request and so it is not guaranteed that these calls will do the garbage collection.
This decision is taken by the JVM based on the eden space availability in heap memory. The JVM specification leaves this
choice to the implementation and so these details are implementation specific. Undoubtedly we know that the garbage
collection process cannot be forced.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.  Heap and Stack are part of JVM but they are used for different purposes.
    Differences are as follows:
   1. Size: Heap space in Java is much bigger than the Stack memory.
   2. Resizing: JVM allows to resize both heap and stack, but need to use different JVM flags for that.
   3. Usage: Heap memory is used to store objects, no mater where u created that object. Stack memory is used to
     store primitive variables and reference variables, method frames and call stack.
   4. Visibility: Heap memory is shared by all threads hence it is also known as the main memory but stack memory
      is local to threads and local variable created there was not visible to others.
   5. Order: Heap is a large memory area where objects can be created and stored in any order but Stack memory
      is structured as Stack data structure i.e. LIFO where method calls are stored as last in first out order.
   6. Error Type: When heap and stack memory are filled different error are being generated.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Reflection is used to describe code which is able to ispect other code in the same system. it help the user gain
insight and see how to move foward.

what is multithreading in java?
A. It is the process that we use to execute multiple threads simultaneously.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. Is used to provide mutually exclusive acces to a shared resource with multiple java threads.

What is Framework?
A. A framework is nothing but large bodies of java codes where you can apply your own code to solve problems in the
specific domain.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. Selenium
   testNG
   JUnit
   Cucumber
   DB Unit.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. The main difference is the scope and dependency.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A. The dependecies are:
   mongo-java-driver-3.4.0.jar
   mysql-connector-java-5.1.41-bin.jar

what is dependency injection in java?
A. This means that if I create an file or program with some dependencies I also include the dependencies on the project
so if another user try to acces to it, it has the dependencies already in it.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. The binding which can be resolved at compile time by compiler is known as static or early binding. Binding of all
the static, private and final methods is done at compile-time.
